# Worker Sideband Protocol (JSON Lines)

This document describes the minimal sideband protocol between the server and a worker process.
The channel is a JSON-lines stream (one JSON object per line) carried over an IPC pipe.

## Transport

- Availability:
  - Unix: worker inherits two file descriptors via environment variables:
    - `MCP_CONSOLE_IPC_READ_FD`
    - `MCP_CONSOLE_IPC_WRITE_FD`
  - Windows: worker connects to two server-created named pipes via
    environment variables:
    - `MCP_CONSOLE_IPC_PIPE_TO_WORKER`
    - `MCP_CONSOLE_IPC_PIPE_FROM_WORKER`
- Messages are serialized as UTF-8 JSON, one message per line.

## Direction: server -> worker

`stdin_write`
- `{ "type": "stdin_write", "text": <string> }`
- Emitted before the server writes the input payload to stdin.

`interrupt`
- `{ "type": "interrupt" }`
- Sent when the server issues an interrupt.
- For R, worker-side handlers clear any pending queued input.
- Indicates that readline/prompt handling should discard any remaining buffered stdin bytes
  from the pending request before normal completion signaling resumes.

`session_end`
- `{ "type": "session_end" }`
- Sent when the server is ending the current session (for example restart/shutdown).
- Worker treats this as shutdown intent and stops consuming further stdin payloads.

## Direction: worker -> server

`backend_info`
- `{ "type": "backend_info", "language": <string>, "supports_images": <bool> }`
- Sent once on startup after the sideband connection is established.

`readline_start`
- `{ "type": "readline_start", "prompt": <string> }`
- Emitted before each readline call to indicate the prompt that will be shown.
  The prompt string is required; use an empty string if the backend did not supply one.

`readline_result`
- `{ "type": "readline_result", "prompt": <string>, "line": <string> }`
- Emitted after a line is read. Includes the prompt and the line that was consumed.
- The server can reconstruct echoed readline bytes as `prompt + line` for conservative
  echo suppression. Output streams remain unframed.

`request_end`
- `{ "type": "request_end" }`
- Marks the end of output for the request. This is the primary completion signal.

`plot_image`
- `{ "type": "plot_image", "id": <string>, "mime_type": <string>, "data": <base64>, "is_new": <bool> }`
- Image payload for plot updates.

`session_end`
- `{ "type": "session_end" }`
- Indicates the worker session is terminating.

## Notes

- Output streams (stdout/stderr) remain on the main pipes and are captured separately.
- The server uses `request_end` as the logical completion signal for a request.
- To reduce IPC-vs-output capture races, the server applies a short post-`request_end` settle
  window so output reader threads can drain final bytes before snapshotting output.
- On timeout, a request may remain pending; later polls can observe the delayed `request_end`
  and finish the request.
