# Docs Index

`docs/index.md` is the source-of-truth map for agent-facing repository knowledge.
Use it to find the current architecture, testing workflow, debugging surfaces, and
checked-in execution plans without relying on stale notes.

## Start Here

- `docs/architecture.md`: current subsystem map for the CLI, server, worker, sandbox, and output surfaces.
- `docs/testing.md`: public validation surface and snapshot workflow.
- `docs/debugging.md`: debug logs, `--debug-repl`, and wire tracing.
- `docs/sandbox.md`: sandbox modes, writable roots, and client-driven sandbox updates.
- `docs/worker_sideband_protocol.md`: server/worker IPC contract.
- `docs/plans/AGENTS.md`: when to write a checked-in execution plan and where it lives.

## Normative Docs

- `docs/tool-descriptions/repl_tool.md`: backend-neutral `repl` description.
- `docs/tool-descriptions/repl_tool_r.md`: R-specific `repl` behavior.
- `docs/tool-descriptions/repl_tool_python.md`: Python-specific `repl` behavior.
- `docs/tool-descriptions/repl_reset_tool.md`: `repl_reset` behavior.
- `README.md`: user-facing overview and installation guide. Treat it as product documentation, not the engineering source of truth.

## Exploratory Docs

- `docs/notes/`: ideas and sketches that may lead to later work.
- `docs/futurework/`: candidate follow-on designs that are not current repository contract.

## Maintenance Rules

- Add new normative docs here in the same PR that introduces them.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` short and use it as a pointer back to this index.
- Prefer moving completed execution plans into `docs/plans/completed/` instead of leaving one-off plan files at the top of `docs/`.
