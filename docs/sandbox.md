# Sandbox

`mcp-repl` applies an OS sandbox to worker processes unless the sandbox policy is
`danger-full-access`.

For a full configuration model (ordering semantics, preset install behavior, domain restrictions,
and OS/platform intersections), see `docs/sandbox-config.md`.

## Default policy

When no CLI sandbox mode is provided, the default is:

- `workspace-write`
- `network_access: false`

When `--sandbox inherit` is used, startup requires a client sandbox update
(`codex/sandbox-state/update`). If no update is provided, startup fails fast.

The worker also gets a per-session temp directory, exported as:

- `TMPDIR`
- `MCP_CONSOLE_R_SESSION_TMPDIR`

## Configure sandbox policy

- Base mode: `mcp-repl --sandbox inherit|read-only|workspace-write|danger-full-access`
- Network mode: `mcp-repl --network-mode off|direct|managed` (alias: `--network`)
- Add writable roots (workspace-write only, repeatable):
  `mcp-repl --add-writable-root /absolute/path`
- Add allowed domains (repeatable):
  `mcp-repl --add-allowed-domain <pattern>`
- Advanced overrides:
  `mcp-repl --config key=value` with Codex-shaped keys
- MCP sandbox update method:
  `codex/sandbox-state/update` (capability `codex/sandbox-state`)

Operations are applied strictly in CLI argument order. Later operations win.
`--sandbox ...` resets the base policy at the point where it appears.
`--network-mode` applies a high-level network profile:

- `off`: disable managed mode and keep network disabled where sandbox policy allows toggling
- `direct`: disable managed mode and request direct network access
- `managed`: enable managed mode and request network access in `workspace-write`

Workspace-write-only options are accepted in any mode, but are no-ops unless effective mode is
`workspace-write`.
`--add-allowed-domain` updates managed-network policy only; it does not by itself enable network
access in `workspace-write`.

Managed-proxy ownership:

- `mcp-repl` does not run a domain-filtering proxy process.
- In Codex sessions, managed mode relies on Codex's managed proxy path.
- In non-Codex clients, managed mode requires a compatible proxy environment to be provided by the
  host/client; otherwise managed routing has no usable network path (fail closed).

## macOS behavior

Sandboxing is enforced via `sandbox-exec`.

For `workspace-write`, writable roots include:

- configured `writable_roots` (absolute paths only),
- current working directory,
- R cache roots configured in client policy,
- temp roots (`/tmp`, `TMPDIR` when absolute), and
- the per-session temp directory.

If you also need R data/config roots, add them explicitly with repeatable
`--add-writable-root` entries.

Within writable roots, these subpaths are forced read-only when present:

- `.git`
- `.codex`
- `.agents`

Proxy-aware network behavior when `network_access: true`:

- proxy env vars are inspected (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, and lowercase variants),
- loopback proxy endpoints are allowlisted for outbound traffic,
- proxy configured but no usable loopback endpoint => fail closed (no network),
- `MCP_CONSOLE_MANAGED_NETWORK=1` enforces proxy-only mode,
- `ALLOW_LOCAL_BINDING=1` additionally allows localhost bind/inbound operations.

## Linux behavior

Sandboxing is enforced by a Linux sandbox helper that applies seccomp + Landlock.

- `workspace-write` always includes the per-session temp directory in writable roots.
- `read-only` is translated to a minimal writable setup for the session temp directory only.
- default Linux worker setup disables network unless explicitly enabled.

Optional `bwrap` stage:

- `MCP_CONSOLE_USE_LINUX_BWRAP=1` enables a bubblewrap outer sandbox.
- `MCP_CONSOLE_LINUX_BWRAP_NO_PROC=1` skips `/proc` mounting.
- if `bwrap` is requested but unavailable, worker startup fails fast.

Managed-network behavior on Linux:

- when network is enabled and managed-network mode is enabled, Linux sandbox runs in proxy-routed mode,
- proxy-routed mode requires loopback proxy env vars (`HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY`, etc.),
- in bwrap mode, sandbox networking is isolated and proxy traffic is bridged into the namespace,
- if managed proxy routing is requested but no usable loopback proxy is configured, startup fails fast.

## Windows behavior (experimental)

- R backend is supported with the same policy surface (`read-only`, `workspace-write`, `danger-full-access`).
- Python backend is currently unavailable on Windows (it requires a Unix PTY).
- `read-only` and `workspace-write` are enforced by the Windows sandbox runner.
- `danger-full-access` runs without built-in sandbox enforcement. Use this when isolation is provided externally (for example, running inside a Docker container).
- Some Windows environments may not support the restricted-token setup required by sandboxed modes.
