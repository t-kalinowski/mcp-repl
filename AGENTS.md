# Agent Map

Keep this file short. It is a table of contents, not the full manual.

## Immediate Rules

- If you modified code, run all required checks before replying:
  - `cargo check`
  - `cargo build`
  - `cargo clippy`
  - `cargo test`
  - `cargo +nightly fmt`
- Never pass `--vanilla` to `R` or `Rscript` unless the user explicitly asks for it.

## Start Here

- `docs/index.md`: source-of-truth map for repository docs.
- `docs/architecture.md`: subsystem map for the binary, worker, sandbox, and eval surfaces.
- `docs/testing.md`: public verification surface and snapshot workflow.
- `docs/debugging.md`: debug logs, `--debug-repl`, and stdio tracing.
- `docs/sandbox.md`: sandbox modes and writable-root policy.
- `docs/plans/AGENTS.md`: when to create checked-in execution plans.

## Snapshot Workflow

- Preferred loop:
  - `cargo insta test`
  - `cargo insta pending-snapshots`
  - `cargo insta review` or `cargo insta accept` / `cargo insta reject`
- CI-style validation: `cargo insta test --check --unreferenced=reject`
- For broad intentional snapshot migrations: `cargo insta test --force-update-snapshots --accept`
- Do not delete `tests/snapshots/*.snap.new` manually. Use `cargo insta reject`.

## Planning Rule

- For multi-phase refactors, redesigns, or other work that spans discovery, iteration, and implementation, keep a living plan under `docs/plans/active/` until the initiative is complete.
- Use the plan to capture design decisions, rejected options, phase boundaries, unresolved questions, and the next safe slice of work so a later agent does not need to rediscover them.
- If you pause or hand off work mid-task, update the plan before stopping.
- Do not create plan files for routine, obvious, or low-risk changes. Keep the plans area useful, not noisy.
- Move completed plans to `docs/plans/completed/`.
- Treat `docs/notes/` and `docs/futurework/` as exploratory, not normative.
